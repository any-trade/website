<h1>Your Gateway to Perpetual Tokens, Indices and Real World Assets.</h1>
<h2>What is Any.trade?</h2>
<p>Any.trade is a perpetual futures platform for tokens, indices, and real-world assets (RWAs). It enables users to trade any imaginable asset and time series, leveraging decentralized oracles for data collection. Any.trade features its own purpose-built Layer 1 for lightning-fast trades, orders, and transfers. As a result, users can enjoy the benefits of centralized exchanges, such as high liquidity, low fees, and no miner extractable value (MEV), alongside the advantages of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which include permissionless access and transparency.</p>
<p>The vision of Any.trade is to establish a platform where virtually anything can be traded. This includes crypto tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum, real-world assets such as stocks, commodities, bonds, and real estate, as well as arbitrary time series data like Twitter followers, Google Trends searches, on-chain volumes, volatilities, or funding rates. Any.trade is specifically tailored for synthetic markets, capable of tracking any type of underlying data.</p>
